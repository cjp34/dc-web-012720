What does CSS Stand for?
Casading style sheets






Flexbox is the most part one-dimensional you can choose to flex either the row or the column but the grid is two-dimensional meaning it can handle both columns and rows at the same time.

So with Grid we have to have a container wrapping our grid items. There are rows and columns in grid but they are defined by the lines.

So each block is a grid cell and think of this like an Excel spreadsheet.

In grid we have tracks, so there are rows and columns but we call these tracks. It can be either the entire row or the entire column

Lastly we have areas, so we can define an area that consists of multiple grid cells. Now an area always has to be either a sqaure or rectangle.
